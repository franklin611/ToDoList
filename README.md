I developed an interactive To Do List GUI where the user can input tasks and their info including that task's status, end date, priority, etc. The tasks can then be organized based on each of the categories outlined on the task section such as by end date and alphabetical order by clicking on the header. The GUI also includes an updating calendar and a motivational quote option when the user needs a boost of motivation. ![ToDoListGUI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121467771/211632432-08e3d0a4-be7c-47c6-8b39-e5ec9f47c83c.png)
